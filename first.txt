What is Network:=
A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

Two very common types of networks include:

1) Local Area Network (LAN)
2) Wide Area Network (WAN)

Mac address :=>
Mac address of a device which is facing a network.

physical address (IP address)
Logical address (Mac address)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) => IANA is responsible for assigine the IP address 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) :=>
	The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN, /ˈaɪkæn/ EYE-kan) is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.[1] ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multistakeholder community.[2][3][4][5]
